# Physics Units

A tool for understanding derived units used in Physics and how they are made up from SI base units. By default, there are six enabled buttons: four SI base units (A, kg, m, and s), a "zero" button to clear.

There are additional buttons not enabled by default that represent various derived units. Once the equivalent unit structure has been displayed, the button for that derived unit will become enabled; for as long as the page is active, that derived unit can also be used for multiplication or division.

Try to make all of the derived units light up by entering the base unit formulas! How many can you do without having to look them up?

## Keyboard shortcuts

All buttons displayed on the form also have a corresponding keyboard shortcut, making it so that the entire experience can be had without needing a mouse.

### Special operations

| Key | Button | Description |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `0` | 0 | Clears display/value. |
| `/` | / | Turns next multiplication operation into division. |

### Unit shortcuts

Click on one of these buttons or press one of the listed shortcut keys to multiply the current display by one of that unit. If the `/` divide button is pressed, the current display will be divided by one of that unit.

#### Base units

These are all enabled by default.

| Key | Button | Unit |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `K` | kg | Kilogram |
| `M` | m | Meter |
| `S` | s | Second |
| `A` | A | Ampere |

#### Derived units

These will only display once their equivalent formulas have been displayed.

| Key | Button | Unit |
| :---: | :---: | :--- |
| `B` | B | Weber |
| `C` | C | Coulomb |
| `F` | F | Farad |
| `G` | S | Siemens |
| `H` | H | Henry |
| `J` | J | Joule |
| `N` | N | Newton |
| `O` | O | Ohm |
| `P` | Pa | Pascal |
| `T` | T | Tesla |
| `V` | V | Volt |
| `W` | W | Watt |
| `Z` | Hz | Hertz |
